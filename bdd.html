        <td valign="top" align="left"><p>Over the summer I typically waitress at a few different  restaurants around my hometown in Pennsylvania.   One of those restaurants is Big Dog Daddy’s at the Lakeside.  The owners of the restaurant, Patti and  Eddie, have a very unique story.  </p>
          <p>In July 2010, Eddie was diagnosed with end stage renal  failure.  He was immediately placed on  dialysis but his health declined rapidly.   He refused to allow his children to be tested as donors because he  feared compromising their health for his own.   As his two children watched their fathers health decline they decided to  be tested without his knowledge.  His  daughter, Trish, was a perfect match and told her father she was donating a  kidney whether he liked it or not.  He  accepted her kidney and is now living a healthy life.  </p>
From his experience he has devoted his life to  raising money for The Gift of Life Foundation and the National Kidney  Fund.  Each year they hold a fundraiser  called the Big Dog Daddy Fest and I pitched their story to our local newspaper and they received great press coverage and the largest  attendance ever for the event.  </td>
